# Codeforces Solutions

My solutions for various Codeforces problems. Visit my Codeforces profile: [@NoDrop30](https://codeforces.com/profile/NoDrop30)

## Repository Structure

This repository contains my solutions to Codeforces contest problems, organized by contest number:

- Each directory is named after the contest number (e.g., `1014`)
- Inside each directory, you'll find solutions to individual problems from that contest
- All solutions are implemented in C++

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- Standard C++ libraries

### Compiling and Running
For any solution file, you can compile and run it using:

```bash
# Compile the code
g++ -std=c++17 -o solution <filename>.cpp

# Run the compiled program
./solution
```

Example:
```bash
# Compile a solution
g++ -std=c++17 -o solution <contest_number>/<problem_name>.cpp

# Run the program
./solution
```

## Input Format
Each solution expects input as described in the corresponding Codeforces problem. Typically, you would input test cases as specified in the problem statement.
